An example of stateful Active Directory Authentication layer implemented using AWS CDK. 

This example utilizes the [CDK-Skylight](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-skylight) [authentication library](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-skylight/blob/main/src/skylight-authentication/ad-authentication.ts) to follow the best practices of Managed AD and Route53 resolvers. 

The example also contains recommended AWS CDK project structure for a realistic Infrastructure-As-Code component decoupled from other parts. It is also designed to be used with other components to deliver a business value (Aka Workload).
